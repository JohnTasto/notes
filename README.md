# Notes

This is my own collection of notes on math, computer science, and programming.

My aim is to keep them both as complete and concise as possible. I use these myself, as it is often quicker to reference something here than to look it up in the documentation. They are not at all intended to teach a subject, only to provide reference for easily forgotten details.

I actually have quite a lot more notes than I am initially posting here, but there is some copywritten material I need to clean out before I post them publicly.

## Format

The math and computer science notes are in Markdown, but they use [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) for math typesetting, and there are a few diagrams written in [Graphvis](http://www.graphviz.org/). Unfortunately, GitHub won't render these Markdown extensions. I use [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://shd101wyy.github.io/markdown-preview-enhanced/#/), an extension available for both [Atom](https://atom.io/) and [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

The programming notes are sort of freeform text files. I did my best to get syntax highlighting working for them for whatever language they are for, but they certainly won't compile or run. Some of them are just collections of Unix commands, so there is no syntax highlighting at all.
